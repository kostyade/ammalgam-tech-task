<p id="description">Test project which allows to fetch user's token balances and historical price data from coingecko</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Install dependencies</p>

```
bun install
```

<p>2. Create .env.local file and add coingecko API key </p>

<p>3. Run</p>

```
bun run dev
```

<h2>Nice to have</h2>

<p>I would make list of tokens static, but task required to fetch it from 3rd party API, so I merged 2 lists from 2 endpoints. Also tt would be nice to add sceletons while data is loading, nice error messages, etc. But for test assignment it looks nice IMO. </p>
